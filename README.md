# LUNA SDK python bindings

Welcome to the **Beta** of PythonBindings for VisionLabs LUNA SDK.
Thank you all for participating of Beta Test.
Please send us your feedback and suggestions to email (info@visionlabs.ru).
With all of your feedback and suggestions you can help us to create very useful feature - calling methods of LUNA SDK through python.

IN pythonBindings there are some supplementary materials you may find useful.
Look into *cmake/* folder for a CMake find script for the SDK. You are not forced to use
CMake but we advise for it.

Currently we support Linux. On Windows everything should work with
Visual Studio 2015 but we do not test this platform. On Linux we tested this code with GCC 4.8.5.
Other versions may work as well. Note, that the SDK is officially supported on RedHat
Linux families (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu 14).

**On Unix (Linux, Ubuntu 14)**

* A compiler with C++11 support
* CMake >= 2.8.12

**On Windows**
was not tested.
* Visual Studio 2015 (required for all Python versions, see notes below)
* CMake >= 3.1

## Installation
From source files of pythonBindings generated a shared library `FaceEngine*.so`.
This library can be installed in system or used without installing.
 
You should do such steps:
1. Download LUNA SDK.

2. Choose directory with pythonBindings within LUNA SDK.

```bash
cd pythonBindings
```
3. **For library building and installing**:

```bash
$ python setup.py install 
```
Library `FaceEngine*.so` will be generated and installed in system.

to uninstall it:

```bash
$ pip uinstall FaceEngine 
```
Possible you'll need sudo rights or use python3 and pip3.

3. **For library building without installing**:

If you want to **build from source files by CMake without installing**:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -DFSDK_ROOT=<path_to_LUNA_SDK>
$ cmake --build . --config Release
```

If you want to point not default version of python or custom path to LUNA SDK you can write for python 2.7:

**Example of building command (from FSDK_ROOT/build):**

```bash
$ cmake .. -DFSDK_ROOT=<FSDK_path> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/python
-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$(python-config --prefix)/lib/libpython2.7.lib -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$(python-config --prefix)/include/python2.7
```
**Example building command (from FSDK_ROOT/build):**
or for `python 3.6`:

```bash
$ cmake .. -DFSDK_ROOT=<FSDK_path> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=/usr/bin/python3.6
-DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$(python-config --prefix)/lib/libpython3.6.lib -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$(python-config --prefix)/include/python3.6
```

## Usage
 
### Library FaceEngine*.so was installed by setup.py

**run a script**:

```bash
$ python script.py
```

**usage example**

```python
import FaceEngine as f
faceEnginePtr = f.createFaceEngine("data", "data/faceengine.conf")
```

### Module FaceEngine*.so was generated by CMake without installing

**run a script**:

```bash
$ python script.py <path to FSDK_ROOT>
```

If FaceEngine*.so was built from sources by CMake pass the path to directory with FaceEngine*.so and add it to system paths:

**usage example**

```python
import sys
sys.path.append(sys.argv[1])
import FaceEngine as fe
```

Other usage examples could be found in `pythonBindings/tests` and `pythonBindings/examples`.

## Test call

From `FSDK_ROOT/pythonBindings`:

```bash
$ python3 pythonBindings/tests/test_image.py --bind-path pythonBindings/build
$ python3 pythonBindings/tests/test_rect.py --bind-path pythonBindings/build
$ python3 pythonBindings/tests/test_estimators.py --bind-path pythonBindings/build
```
## Running examples
Note: data folder must be at \<LUNA_SDK_root\>/data on Windows and on Linux.
```
# Extracting, Matching
$ python3 pythonBindings/examples/example_extractor_matcher.py pythonBindings/build testData/photo_2017-03-30_14-47-43_p.ppm testData/warp1.ppm testData/warp2.ppm

# Detecting, Landmarks, Estimating (Attributes, Quality, Eyes, Head pose and so on)
$ python3 pythonBindings/examples/example.py pythonBindings/build testData/photo_2017-03-30_14-47-43_p.ppm
 
# Detecting and warping
$ python3 pythonBindings/examples/example_detector_warper.py pythonBindings/build testData/photo_2017-03-30_14-47-43_p.ppm
```
**usage of FaceEngine module example**
```python
import FaceEngine as fe
faceEnginePtr = fe.createFaceEngine("data", "data/faceengine.conf")

## Special notes for Windows

**Compiler requirements**

PythonBindings for Windows were not tested.
Pybind11 requires a C++11 compliant compiler, i.e Visual Studio 2015 on Windows.
This applies to all Python versions, including 2.7. Unlike regular C extension
modules, it's perfectly fine to compile a pybind11 module with a VS version newer
than the target Python's VS version. See the [FAQ] for more details.

## About pybind11
PythonBindings use pybind11. pybind11 is a lightweight header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, mainly to create Python bindings of existing C++ code. Its goals and syntax are similar to the excellent Boost.Python library by David Abrahams: to minimize boilerplate code in traditional extension modules by inferring type information using compile-time introspection. Think of this library as a tiny self-contained version of Boost.Python with everything stripped away that isn't relevant for binding generation. Without comments, the core header files only require ~4K lines of code and depend on Python (2.7 or 3.x) and the C++ standard library. This compact implementation was possible thanks to some of the new C++11 language features (specifically: tuples, lambda functions and variadic templates). Since its creation, this library has grown beyond Boost.Python in many ways, leading to dramatically simpler binding code in many common situations.

Tutorial and reference documentation is provided at [doc](http://pybind11.readthedocs.org/en/master). A PDF version of the manual is available [here](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/pybind11/master/pybind11.pdf).
